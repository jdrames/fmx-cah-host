# Cards Against Humanity - Server
A passion project started after Covid19 for friends and family to enjoy. 

This portion is the backend of the game. It hosts a RESTful API and SignalR Server.

The API portion allows user authentication, game creation and joining a game. The SignalR portion handles the game interaction and monitors the status of players. It also clears out any abandoned games.
